# Optimization

In our research, optimization is the underlying method of solving the problems we encounter. Our problems will have a set of unknowns that we want to solve for. We will then formulate the problem so that the solution lies at the minimum or maximum of some function. Optimization problems are usually set up in this way and attempt to find the values of unknowns that achieve the maximum or minima.
